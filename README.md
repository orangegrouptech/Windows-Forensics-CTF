So the other day my friends introduced me to this little browser game called Shell Shockers and it's quite fun, except for the countless times I get absolutely DEMOLISHED by them üò°. I wanted to take revenge on them by downloading some cheats, so I got some exe file on the Internet that claimed to be them. But now it's making my PC BSOD every time I log in!!

Can you help me stop this damn thing from running and restore my desktop? PLEASE??? My mum will kill me to see the family PC in this state üò≠üò≠

In NullSec today, I came across this wild trick to make files totally invisible. Pretty cool, right? Problem is, I went a little overboard and used it to hide all my passwords. Now, they‚Äôre there... but not really there. I bet you can't find them. Or can you? Hehehehe... üòà

No way you found my password!!! But don't worry, that wasn‚Äôt my REAL password... HAHAHAHA! You think you‚Äôre clever? Well, there's more where that came from. Can you figure out my secrets?

So last week, my computer was moving at a snail's pace, like it had just woken up from a 100-year nap. I knew something was up, so I took it to the repair center for a check-up. Turns out, my laptop had a little 'unwanted guest'‚Äîa backdoor service sneaking around, causing all the lag! üò±

The techs worked their magic and got my laptop running smoother than a buttered slide. They even exported some event logs as 'evidence' of the culprit, but... here's the catch... I have NO idea which log holds the secret to this mystery! Can you help me identify the troublemaker?! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª

Hey there, thanks for helping us clean up our family PC from that Shell Shock virus or something we had. I really cannot express my gratitude more. It had a whole 67 slide long presentation that I pretty much had to solo (or duo?) with my intern since my fellow colleague had been MIA the whole time. We spent an ENTIRE MONTH on it, and it would've been WAY more than just an annoyance if I had lost it to that virus.

Anyways, I want to punish my son with something he will never forget. I'm gonna delete his games. Other than that browser game, I know he's still been playing some super violent game even though I banned it. However, I went to Control Panel and couldn't see it listed, so I couldn't uninstall it.

Can you help me locate this game he has? He doesn't have a desktop shortcut so I assume he runs it through some other dialog. Oh and, I see it launch the moment he logs in too, if that helps.
